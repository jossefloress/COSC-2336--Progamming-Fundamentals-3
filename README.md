# COSC-2336--Progamming-Fundamentals-3
Programs I made in my COSC 2336 class. 

The programs/labs in this repository include:
State Machine, Parser, Random Access File, Unbounded Stack, and Unbounded Array.

Inside each lab folder there's a zip file that has all the files for that lab. 

All programs were built on Microsoft Visual Studio
